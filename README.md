## What is Context Steering?

Context steering is an advanced steering behavior technique used in game development for autonomous agent movement. It provides smooth, intelligent navigation by:

1. **Context Maps**: Creating directional interest maps that evaluate movement options
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Using danger maps to avoid collisions
3. **Behavior Combination**: Blending multiple steering behaviors seamlessly

## Project Structure

### TypeScript Implementation (Cocos Creator)
- `assets/scripts/Agent.ts` - Core agent with context steering behavior
- `assets/scripts/ContextSteeringManager.ts` - Scene manager for spawning agents and obstacles
- `assets/scripts/cc-mock.ts` - Mock Cocos Creator types for compilation
- `assets/scene.scene` - Cocos Creator scene setup

### Standalone Demo
- `demo.html` - Interactive browser demo showcasing context steering

## Features Implemented

- **Context Maps**: 16-direction interest evaluation
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Dynamic danger mapping with falloff
- **Smooth Steering**: Force-based movement with velocity limits
- **Visual Feedback**: Agent direction indicators and obstacle visualization
- **Interactive Demo**: Click to add agents/obstacles and observe behavior

## How Context Steering Works

1. **Interest Generation**: Agents prefer to continue in their current direction
2. **Danger Detection**: Nearby obstacles create danger in specific directions
3. **Context Combination**: Interest is reduced by danger to find safe directions
4. **Steering Forces**: Best direction is converted to steering force
5. **Movement**: Forces are applied to velocity with realistic physics

## Usage

### Cocos Creator Project
1. Open the project in Cocos Creator 3.8.7+
2. The scene contains a ContextSteeringManager that spawns agents and obstacles
3. Run the project to see context steering in action

### Browser Demo
1. Open `demo.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click to add agents, Ctrl+Click to add obstacles
3. Watch agents intelligently navigate around obstacles

## Technical Details

- **Context Map Resolution**: 16 directional slots (22.5¬∞ each)
- **Detection Range**: 3x agent radius for obstacle detection
- **Danger Spread**: Adjacent slots receive proportional danger
- **Force Limiting**: Steering forces are capped for realistic movement
- **Boundary Handling**: Agents wrap around screen edges

This implementation demonstrates the power of context steering for creating believable autonomous movement in games and simulations."
